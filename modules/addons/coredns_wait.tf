# =============================================================================
# CoreDNS Readiness Gate
#
# Waits for CoreDNS to become Ready after Cilium has deployed, and
# automatically recovers stuck helm-install-rke2-coredns installer pods.
#
# Problem: RKE2's internal HelmChart controller deploys CoreDNS via a Job.
# The Job pod (helm-install-rke2-coredns-*) can get stuck in ContainerCreating
# if the kubelet is under backpressure during cluster bootstrap. This prevents
# CoreDNS from deploying, which in turn can cause platform controllers that
# resolve cloud APIs to crash-loop while DNS is unavailable.
#
# Fix: Poll for CoreDNS readiness. After a 2-minute grace period, force-delete
# any stuck installer pods. The Job controller immediately creates a new pod
# which starts successfully once the cluster stabilises.
#
# Provider-neutral add-ons can depend on this resource when they need DNS before
# their controllers start.
#
# When kubeconfig_path is null (subsequent applies, cluster already running),
# CoreDNS is already up — this resource is a no-op.
