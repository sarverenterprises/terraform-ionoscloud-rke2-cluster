# =============================================================================
# Cilium CNI
#
# Cilium is enabled by default because a CNI is always required for the cluster
# to function. Set enable_cilium=false only when another Terraform state already
# owns the existing cilium Helm release.
#
# Key design constraints:
#   - routingMode/tunnelProtocol replaces the deprecated `tunnel` key (≥1.14)
#   - kubeProxyReplacement stays disabled for a conservative first cut while no
#     IONOS CCM/LB integration is managed by this module.
#   - MTU 1450 = 1500 (typical NIC MTU) - 50 (VXLAN overhead); set explicitly to
#     avoid auto-detection picking the wrong interface in multi-NIC nodes
#   - operator.replicas = 2 for HA; a single operator is a SPOF for IPAM

# CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy: block metadata API egress
#
# Cloud provider metadata APIs (169.254.169.254) can be reachable from pods by
# default. This policy denies egress to it cluster-wide, preventing workloads
# from leaking credentials or enumerating instance metadata.
#
# Two implementations, selected by var.kubeconfig_path:
#
#   kubeconfig_path != null → null_resource + kubectl local-exec
#     Used on initial cluster deploy when CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy CRD
#     does not exist yet at plan time. The kubernetes_manifest provider
#     validates CRD kinds against the live API at plan time, causing
#     "API did not recognize GroupVersionKind" errors even when depends_on
#     is set. kubectl apply runs only at apply time, after helm_release.cilium
#     completes and the CRD is registered.
#
#   kubeconfig_path == null → kubernetes_manifest
#     Used on subsequent applies (or in workspaces where no kubeconfig file
#     exists on disk) once Cilium CRDs are already present in the cluster.
